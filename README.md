### Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing credit card data to extract valuable insights. It involves data processing using Excel, database creation and management in MySQL Workbench, and data visualization using Power BI.

### Data and Tools
* **Data:** Credit card transaction data in Excel format.
* **Tools:**
  * Excel: Data cleaning, transformation, and initial analysis.
  * MySQL Workbench: Database creation, data import, and SQL queries.
  * Power BI: Data visualization, dashboard creation, and interactive reports.

### Project Structure
The project directory contains the following:
* **Excel:** Contains the original credit card data and processed Excel files.
* **SQL:** Contains SQL scripts for creating database, tables, and importing data.
* **Database:** Contains the MySQL database with tables and data.
* **PowerBI:** Contains Power BI reports and dashboards.
* **PPT:** Contains the presentation with insights and findings.

### Project Workflow
1. **Data Preparation:**
   * Import credit card data into Excel.
   * Clean and preprocess data (handle missing values, outliers, etc.).
   * Create necessary columns and calculations.

2. **Database Creation:**
   * Create a MySQL database.
   * Design database schema with relevant tables and columns.
   * Import processed data from Excel into MySQL tables.

3. **Data Analysis:**
   * Perform SQL queries to explore and analyze data.
   * Create views or stored procedures for complex calculations.

4. **Data Visualization:**
   * Connect Power BI to the MySQL database.
   * Create visualizations (charts, graphs, tables) to represent insights.
   * Build interactive dashboards for exploration.

5. **Insights and Presentation:**
   * Analyze the generated visualizations and extract key findings.
   * Create a PowerPoint presentation summarizing the project and insights.

### Dependencies
* Microsoft Excel
* MySQL Workbench
